# To-Do-List
This app allows you to 
* list out the works that you want to complete
+ strike off the works that are completed
- and delete the works permenantly

The app is dynamic, i.e the changes made to the to-do list will be stored in the browser's local storage, so you can continue from where you left off the last time.
